## DevOps Special Milestone

## Cloud Migration Assessment Framework

Many existing companies are exploring the possibility of migrating their application onto cloud

Some applications can be migrated to cloud without making any architectural changes. But certain applications need extensive changes in the architecture, networking, storage and also, its security components before being migrated.

In this milestone, we provide a framework that assesses and analyzes the current architectural design of the application and informs the user, if the application is cloud-ready on the basis of Compute, Networking, Storage, Architecture, Security and Compliance requirements.  

### Implementation

A [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQZN2ky9q9jCyHIQFXNMgT7D4Kl0tL7dMqAI-tediOzcnUCQ/viewform) is used to fetch the details from the user and the responses are fed to an appscript to determine the feasibility of workload migration over to the cloud.

The flow of the appscript is as per the below tree diagram: ![Cloud readiness Flow diagram](https://github.ncsu.edu/rpathur/DevOpsProject/blob/Milestone4/MS4-SPECIAL/Cloud%20readiness%20diagram.jpg)

The major factors deciding the feasibility of migration of the application onto cloud are as follows:
* **Compute requirement**

* **Network requirement**

* **Storage requirement**

* **Securoty & Compliance**

* **Application architecture**

* **Network**
The script calculates the score for various aspects of the application. It also, generates various pictographic representations like bar graphs and pie charts based on the previous inputs from other users, which would assist the user in choosing from the various possible solutions.
